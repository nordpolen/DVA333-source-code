# Real-Time Remote Vehicle Control over TSN and 5G

This project demonstrates a real-time remote-controlled vehicle system using **Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN)** and **private 5G** infrastructure. It enables low-latency video streaming and control signal transmission across a multi-node architecture.

## üöó System Architecture

The project consists of three main components:

### 1. Client (`client.py`)
- Sends steering commands via joystick over UDP.
- Receives and displays MJPEG video stream from the server.

### 2. Gateway / Middleman (`enhanced_gateway.py`)
- Translates DSCP to PCP for VLAN tagging.
- Routes control commands and video stream between client and server.
- Reassembles and re-fragments JPEG frames for UDP transmission.

### 3. Server / Vehicle (`server.py`)
- Captures and encodes video using onboard camera.
- Sends VLAN-tagged Ethernet frames to the gateway.
- Receives and interprets steering commands to control GPIO and PWM.

|--------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `client.py`        | Sends joystick-based steering commands and displays video stream.    |
| `enhanced_gateway.py` | Middleman that handles DSCP-PCP mapping and routes traffic.        |
| `server.py`        | Server-side logic for camera capture and car movement control.       |

## üñ•Ô∏è How to Run

### On the Server (Robot Car):
sudo python3 server.py

### On the Gateway:
sudo python3 enhanced_gateway.py

### On the Client:
python3 client.py

**Note:** Root permissions may be required for raw sockets and GPIO access.
